### Hi, I'm Sarah ðŸ‘‹

While studiying medicine, I discovered and dove into coding and statistics. I became since then a health data scientist. I have been practicing with passion since 2015. I also teach R and statistics to researchers and medical doctors.

You will find here a sample of previous projects. Most of the data I worked on was protected but I will try to add simulated data to the projects in the future.
